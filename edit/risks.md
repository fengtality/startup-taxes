## Software can't replace the complex job of an accountant.
While it's impossible for an app to replace every aspect of an accountant's job, it may be possible to focus initially on aspects that are rote, repetitive and depend on data.

## Since companies only file taxes once a year, the cycle time is too long for a startup to become a habitual necessity.
