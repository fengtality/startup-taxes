## Advent of the digital-native company

Ingesting, formatting and reconciling data comprises 90% of an accountant's job.  Currently, this is time-consuming, highly manual process because accountants accept data in the form of paper documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, and phone screenshots.

For many new tech startups, this data import process is unnecessary because the systems of record that contain all their transactions relevant to corporate taxes are cloud-based or offer APIs:

* Accounting: Quickbooks Online, Xero, Netsuite

* CRM: Salesforce
* Expenses: Abacus, Expensify
* Bank: Yodlee, Plaid APIs
