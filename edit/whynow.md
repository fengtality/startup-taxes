Ingesting, formatting and reconciling data comprises 90% of an accountant's job.  Currently, this is time-consuming, highly manual process because accountants accept data in the form of paper documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, and phone screenshots.

For many newer tech startups, this data import process can be greatly shortened because all of their relevant financial transactions are in systems that expose APIs.
