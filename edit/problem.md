## Startup taxes are painful

As a startup founder, taxes are the last thing you want to spend your precious time on.  However, you're also cognizant that screwing them up can be extremely harmful to your company.  Therefore, you pay experts to make the problem go away.

Taxes are a big source of anxiety because they are:

### Expensive

Founders pay $2k to $15k per year to accounting firms to help them fulfill tax obligations.

> For all Finance & Accounting, we paid a total of ~ $12K for 2015 and ~ $7K for 2016. This includes tax. I think 2015 also included $4K for a 409A valuation. My bookkeeping needs are very modest, ~ $2-300/year.[^1]

> We pay between $3k to $5k per month to our CPA for bookkeeping and tax services. [^2]

### Time-consuming

Founders invest dozen of hours per year into providing accounting firms the information they need: answering questions, filling out questionnaires, exporting data from systems of record, and emailing them documentary evidence.

### Costly if not done right

Getting taxes wrong can have a material impact on a company.  For instance:

* not filing 83-b elections
* not paying Delaware franchise tax
* not registering as a foreign corporation in California
* not withholding tax for international contractors
* not paying sales/VAT tax

> I paid our accountant $2k per year for corporate taxes and usually another $2k to clean up the books which I maintained myself.  When I first hired them, they were a lifesaver because they discovered that we had omitted to register as a CA foreign corporation, which meant that we couldn't sell anything.  I gladly paid them about $4k to rectify the issue. [^3]

### Sub-optimal

While startups stand to benefit from recent changes in tax laws, such as the R&D payroll tax credit and the treatment of cell phone reimbursements as non-taxable expenses, many accounting firms are.  However, accounting firms are not incentivized to maximize their clients' tax positions because they are paid on a flat fee basis.

### Not future-proof

As startups get larger and start needing audited financial statements (usually Series B), they need to reconcile past financial statements and tax filings for their auditors.  Since past tax filings are primarily in paper format with scant electronic documentation, this process can be extremely time-consuming and expensive.
