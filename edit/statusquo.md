### Corporate taxes

Startups typically hire small, local accounting firms to tax-related obligations. Some startups also hire these firms for day-to-day bookkeeping.  This is an extremely fragmented, non-technically savvy industry.

Some DIY using TaxAct or TurboTax Small Business, but this is a small minority of companies.  Anecdotally, Intuit isn't focusing on growing TurboTax Small Business currently because it accounts for a tiny sliver (<1%) of the revenues earned by TurboTax's consumer editions.

### Payroll taxes

Each quarter, startups need to file Form 941 and pay withholding taxes on salaries that they pay full-time employees.  At year end, they need to file Form 1099-MISC for their contractors.  Payroll processors such as Gusto and Intuit Payroll handle these aspects for US-based employees and contractors.  

Currently, it appears that companies with international employees and contractors need to manage payroll and tax for them manually.

### Sales tax and VAT

While software solutions such as [Avalara](https://www.avalara.com/) and Taxjar exist, they still require integration with billing and ERP systems.  Smaller startups usually ignore these issues until they get big enough.  

At my prior company (Nitro), the complexity of integrating VAT-related tax solutions prevented us from selling certain products outside the United States.
