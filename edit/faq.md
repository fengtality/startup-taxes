## How can an app replace the complex job of an accountant?
While it's impossible for an app to replace every aspect of an accountant's job, it may be possible to focus on a single aspect and offer the best-of-breed version of it as a service to the subset of companies who have that need.  For example:
* Handle R&D payroll tax credit
* Identify reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses
* Handle sales tax and VAT

Also, it may be possible to segment accounting tasks by complexity and data availability.  The app would handles simpler tasks at first.

| Task complexity       | Data availability     | Example                       |
| :--------------       | :-------------        | :------                       |
| Simple                | Yes                   | Revenue recognition           | 
| Simple                | No                    | Transaction classification    |
| Complex               | Yes                   | International tax recognition |
| Complex               | No                    | Financial planning |

## You aren’t a CPA. Why are you qualified to build this company?
* Access to customers: I was a startup CEO and know a lot of other founders in my network
* Domain expertise: I did bookkeeping and 409A valuations myself for my startup.  Also, I have a good grasp of tax accounting from being an investment banker for 9 years.
* Technical skillset: I’m a product manager, data scientist and front-end software engineer

## Accounting is dominated by branded consortiums of local, relationship-based fiefdoms.  How will you achieve scale in this market?
I think this is the #1 risk.  As companies in every industry move their systems of record to the cloud, I will maintain an edge based on data integrations and algorithmic decisions fueled by it


## Why not a bookkeeping app?
While bookkeeping has a big advantage over taxes in that it has a much shorter cycle time; transactions hit the books every day.  However, I think it's more difficult for a new entrant to demonstrate outperformance versus the status quo and has high switching costs.

In contrast, the competition for tax are local CPA firms, homegrown solutions, or nothing at all.
