## What is this?

A living business plan[^1] about applying technology to the accounting industry, starting with a product that **makes taxes simpler and easier for startups**.

[^1]: These days, founders shy away from business plans in favor of brief, beautifully designed presentations.  While that format makes sense when you're presenting for 5 minutes at Demo Day, the good presentations invariably are the result of months, if not years, of work: research, interviews, experiments, and planning.  This site details that work.

## Why accounting?

Accounting, a $160 billion[^2] industry that employs 3 million people[^3] in the US, is ripe for technological disruption.

Abstractions like AWS and Docker have sucked the complexity out of engineering operations, enabling a single engineer to be as productive 10 dozen engineers back in the day.  Yet the financial operations side of the business still employs armies of staff accountants and pays exorbitant fees to CPA firms to handle accounting, tax and audit related work.  

The vast majority of this work is importing, formatting, and reconciling data.  With the migration of financial transaction data to systems that expose APIs, software can now automate this data pipeline.  While human experts will always need to make complex judgments, machine learning can boost their productivity and accuracy with probabilistic recommendations based on similar decisions.

## What might this look like at scale?

Today, the Big 4 accounting firms employ a combined 818,000 people and generate $124 billion in combined revenues[^2].  In 10 years, they may be replaced with one or more firms that employ 10% of the people while generating the same or more in revenues.

## Why start with taxes?

From keeping clean books to working with external auditors, there are many painful accounting-related tasks.  However, I think taxes is the most promising place to start for a new entrant because it's relatively easy to **definitively demonstrate outperformance versus the status quo**: 

* Restating the prior year's taxes to take advantage of a missed credit or deduction saves startups from paying higher taxes.
* Instituting a sales tax/VAT calculation and remittance process for startups who currently ignore these taxes reduces their audit and non-compliance risk.

Ensuring tax compliance is complex and important, and thus should be performed by an expert.  However, since at its core the process of tax compliance is applying a set a of decision functions to structured data, **this work should be performed by an intelligent software agent, not a human**.  

## Who are you?

I was the CEO and co-founder of [doxIQ](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doxiq#/entity), a document analytics startup [acquired](https://blog.gonitro.com/2015/10/nitro-acquires-doxiq-to-deepen-analytics-footprint/) by [Nitro](https://www.gonitro.com/).  Both as a startup founder and as director of product at Nitro, I spent a lot of time and effort dealing with tax-related issues, ranging from filing corporate taxes, calculating R&D credits, and accounting for VAT reporting.

## Why make this plan public?

**Ideas are cheap; execution is what matters**: a lesson that I learned the hard way the first time around.

Also, since the status quo alternatives are a fragmented set of non-technical CPA firms, I think the benefits of being public outweigh competitive risks.

Another lesson was: **don't be shy about asking for help and feedback**.  If you're a startup CEO/CFO who hates dealing with taxes or just have a tax-related question, ping me at mifeng[at]gmail.com.
