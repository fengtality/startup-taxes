## What is this?

A living business plan[^1] about applying technology to the accounting industry, starting with a product that **makes taxes simpler and easier for startups**.

[^1]: These days, founders shy away from business plans in favor of brief, beautifully designed presentations.  While that format makes sense when you're presenting for 5 minutes at Demo Day, the good presentations invariably are the result of months, if not years, of work: research, interviews, experiments, and planning.  This site details that work.

## Why accounting?

Accounting is an industry ripe for technological disruption.

Abstractions like AWS and Docker have sucked the complexity out of engineering operations, enabling a single engineer to be as productive as a dozen engineers back in the day.  Yet the financial operations side of the business still employs armies of staff accountants and pays exorbitant fees to CPA firms to handle accounting, tax and audit related work.  

The vast majority of this work is importing, formatting, and reconciling data.  With the migration of financial transaction data to systems that expose APIs, software can now automate this data pipeline.  While human expers will always need to make complex judgments, machine learning can boost their productivity and accuracy with probalistic recommendations based on similar decisions.

## Why start with taxes?

1. Easier to demonstrate outperformance
2. Fewer software-based competitors

## Why make this plan public?

When I started my first company, I closely guarded my idea and didn't ask for help.  This time around, I'm trying a different approach: making the idea public so that I can ask for help and feedback easily.

## Who are you?

I was the CEO and co-founder of a startup that was [acquired](https://blog.gonitro.com/2015/10/nitro-acquires-doxiq-to-deepen-analytics-footprint/) by [Nitro](https://www.gonitro.com/).  Both at my own startup and at Nitro, I spent a lot of time and effort dealing with tax issues, from corporate taxes, R&D credits, and VAT calculation and reporting.
