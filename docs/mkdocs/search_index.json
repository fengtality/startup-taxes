However, you're also cognizant that screwing them up can be extremely harmful to your company.  Therefore, you pay experts to make the problem go away.\n\n\nTaxes are a big source of anxiety because they are:\n\n\nExpensive\n\n\nFounders pay $2k to $15k per year to accounting firms to help them fulfill tax obligations.\n\n\n\n\nFor all Finance \n Accounting, we paid a total of ~ $12K for 2015 and ~ $7K for 2016. This includes tax. I think 2015 also included $4K for a 409A valuation. My bookkeeping needs are very modest, ~ $2-300/year.\n1\n\n\nWe pay between $3k to $5k per month to our CPA for bookkeeping and tax services. \n2\n\n\n\n\nTime-consuming\n\n\nFounders invest dozen of hours per year into providing accounting firms the information they need: answering questions, filling out questionnaires, exporting data from systems of record, and emailing them documentary evidence.\n\n\nCostly if not done right\n\n\nGetting taxes wrong can have a material impact on a company.  For instance:\n\n\n\n\nnot filing 83-b elections\n\n\nnot paying Delaware franchise tax\n\n\nnot registering as a foreign corporation in California\n\n\nnot withholding tax for international contractors\n\n\nnot paying sales/VAT tax\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI paid our accountant $2k per year for corporate taxes and usually another $2k to clean up the books which I maintained myself.  When I first hired them, they were a lifesaver because they discovered that we had omitted to register as a CA foreign corporation, which meant that we couldn't sell anything.  I gladly paid them about $4k to rectify the issue. \n3\n\n\n\n\nSub-optimal\n\n\nWhile startups stand to benefit from recent changes in tax laws, such as the R\nD payroll tax credit and the treatment of cell phone reimbursements as non-taxable expenses, many accounting firms are.  However, accounting firms are not incentivized to maximize their clients' tax positions because they are paid on a flat fee basis.\n\n\nNot future-proof\n\n\nAs startups get larger and start needing audited financial statements (usually Series B), they need to reconcile past financial statements and tax filings for their auditors.  Since past tax filings are primarily in paper format with scant electronic documentation, this process can be extremely time-consuming and expensive.\n\n\nStatus quo solutions\n\n\nStartups use different providers for tax-related obligations:\n\n\nCorporate tax\n\n\nStartups typically hire small, local accounting firms to tax-related obligations. Some startups also hire these firms for day-to-day bookkeeping.  This is an extremely fragmented, non-technically savvy industry.\n\n\nPayroll tax\n\n\nEach quarter, startups need to file Form 941 and pay withholding taxes on salaries that they pay full-time employees.  At year end, they need to file Form 1099-MISC for their contractors.  Payroll processors such as Gusto and Intuit Payroll handle these aspects for US-based employees and contractors.  \n\n\nCurrently, it appears that companies with international employees and contractors need to manage payroll and tax for them manually.\n\n\n\n\nReminder\n\n\nCheck with smaller startups like Appfluence like how they handle international employees\n\n\n\n\nSales tax and VAT\n\n\nWhile software solutions such as \nAvalara\n and Taxjar exist, they still require integration with billing and ERP systems.  Smaller startups usually ignore these issues until they get big enough.  \n\n\nAt my prior company (Nitro), the complexity of integrating VAT-related tax solutions prevented us from selling certain products outside the United States.\n\n\nThe opportunity\n\n\nEnsuring tax compliance is complex and important, and thus should be performed by an expert.  However, since at its core the process of tax compliance is applying a set a of decision functions to structured data, \nthe work should be performed by an intelligent software agent, not a human\n.  \n\n\nFor personal taxes, individuals have increasingly relied on software (TurboTax).  For the payroll tax sub-component, companies have recently started to use software (Gusto).  However, the bulk of tax-related work for companies is still being performed by a fragmented set of local accounting firms.  \n\n\nA software-based solution focused on serving the needs of early-stage startups can be better, cheaper and more future-proof than the status quo.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nHow much do companies spend on taxes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder of a post-angel, pre-seed startup with revenues under $1m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder of a post-seed, pre-Series A startup with revenues over $1m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe, at my last startup.",
