## Startup taxes are painful

As a startup founder, taxes are the last thing you want to spend your precious time on.  However, you're also cognizant that screwing them up can be extremely harmful to your company.  Therefore, you pay experts to make the problem go away.

Taxes are a big source of anxiety because they are:

### Expensive

Founders pay $2k to $15k per year to accounting firms to help them fulfill tax obligations.

> For all Finance & Accounting, we paid a total of ~ $12K for 2015 and ~ $7K for 2016. This includes tax. I think 2015 also included $4K for a 409A valuation. My bookkeeping needs are very modest, ~ $2-300/year.[^1]

> We pay between $3k to $5k per month to our CPA for bookkeeping and tax services. [^2]

### Time-consuming

Founders invest dozen of hours per year into providing accounting firms the information they need: answering questions, filling out questionnaires, exporting data from systems of record, and emailing them documentary evidence.

### Costly if not done right

Getting taxes wrong can have a material impact on a company.  For instance:

* not filing 83-b elections
* not paying Delaware franchise tax
* not registering as a foreign corporation in California
* not withholding tax for international contractors
* not paying sales/VAT tax

> I paid our accountant $2k per year for corporate taxes and usually another $2k to clean up the books which I maintained myself.  When I first hired them, they were a lifesaver because they discovered that we had omitted to register as a CA foreign corporation, which meant that we couldn't sell anything.  I gladly paid them about $4k to rectify the issue. [^3]

### Sub-optimal

While startups stand to benefit from recent changes in tax laws, such as the R&D payroll tax credit and the treatment of cell phone reimbursements as non-taxable expenses, many accounting firms are.  However, accounting firms are not incentivized to maximize their clients' tax positions because they are paid on a flat fee basis.

### Not future-proof

As startups get larger and start needing audited financial statements (usually Series B), they need to reconcile past financial statements and tax filings for their auditors.  Since past tax filings are primarily in paper format with scant electronic documentation, this process can be extremely time-consuming and expensive.

## Status quo solutions

Startups use different providers for tax-related obligations:

### Corporate tax

Startups typically hire small, local accounting firms to tax-related obligations. Some startups also hire these firms for day-to-day bookkeeping.  This is an extremely fragmented, non-technically savvy industry.

### Payroll tax

Each quarter, startups need to file Form 941 and pay withholding taxes on salaries that they pay full-time employees.  At year end, they need to file Form 1099-MISC for their contractors.  Payroll processors such as Gusto and Intuit Payroll handle these aspects for US-based employees and contractors.  

Currently, it appears that companies with international employees and contractors need to manage payroll and tax for them manually.

### Sales tax and VAT

While software solutions such as [Avalara](https://www.avalara.com/) and Taxjar exist, they still require integration with billing and ERP systems.  Smaller startups usually ignore these issues until they get big enough.  

At my prior company (Nitro), the complexity of integrating VAT-related tax solutions prevented us from selling certain products outside the United States.

## The opportunity

Ensuring tax compliance is complex and important, and thus should be performed by an expert.  However, since at its core the process of tax compliance is applying a set a of decision functions to structured data, **the work should be performed by an intelligent software agent, not a human**.  

For personal taxes, individuals have increasingly relied on software (TurboTax).  For the payroll tax sub-component, companies have recently started to use software (Gusto).  However, the bulk of tax-related work for companies is still being performed by a fragmented set of local accounting firms.  

A software-based solution focused on serving the needs of early-stage startups can be better, cheaper and more future-proof than the status quo.
