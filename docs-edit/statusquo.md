## Problem

For early-stage startups, properly fulfilling corporate tax obligations is:

* **Expensive**: Founders pay $2k to $15k per year to accounting firms to help them fulfill tax obligations.

* **Time-consuming**: Founders invest dozen of hours per year into providing accounting firms the information they need: answering questions, filling out questionnaires, exporting data from systems of record, and emailing them documentary evidence.

* **Costly if not done right**: Getting taxes wrong can have a material impact on a company.  For instance: not filing 83-b elections, not paying Delaware franchise tax, not registering as a foreign corporation in California

* **Sub-optimal**: Startups stand to benefit from recent changes in tax laws, such as the R&D payroll tax credit and the treatment of cell phone reimbursements as non-taxable expenses.  However, accounting firms are not incentivized to maximize their clients' tax positions because they are paid on a flat fee basis.

* **Not future-proof**: As startups get larger and start needing audited financial statements (usually Series B), they need to reconcile past financial statements and tax filings for their auditors.  Since past tax filings are primarily in paper format with scant electronic documentation, this process can be extremely time-consuming and expensive.

## Current solutions

Startups use different providers for tax-related obligations:

* **Corporate taxes**: Startups typically hire small, local accounting firms to tax-related obligations.  These   Some startups also hire these firms for day-to-day bookkeeping

* **Payroll taxes**: Each quarter, startups need to file Form 941 and pay withholding taxes on salaries that they pay full-time employees.  At year end, they need to file Form 1099-MISC for their contractors.  Payroll processors such as Gusto and Intuit Payroll handle these aspects.

* **Sales tax / VAT**: Large and mid-sized startups use software such as [Avalara](https://www.avalara.com/), while smaller startups either aren't diverisified enough or aren't big enough to worry about it.

## The opportunity

Ensuring tax compliance is complex and important, and thus should be performed by an expert.  However, since at its core the process of tax compliance is applying a set a of decision functions to structured data, **the work should be performed by an intelligent software agent, not a human**.  

For personal taxes, individuals have increasingly relied on software (TurboTax).  For the payroll tax sub-component, companies have recently started to use software (Gusto).  However, the bulk of tax-related work for companies is still being performed by a fragmented set of local accounting firms.  

A software-based solution focused on serving the needs of early-stage startups can be better, cheaper and more future-proof than the status quo.
